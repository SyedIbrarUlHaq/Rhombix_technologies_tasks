# Data Science Internship Tasks

This repository contains two key tasks from my internship:

# Task 1: Titanic Classification

Built a model to predict passenger survival using features like age, gender, and socio-economic status.

Key steps: Data preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, and modeling with RandomForestClassifier.


# Task 2: Feature Engineering


Created new features for enhanced predictions, including FamilySize, IsAlone, FarePerPerson, AgeGroup, and Title.

Improved dataset quality and insights for predictive modeling.
