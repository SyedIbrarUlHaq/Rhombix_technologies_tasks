# Data Science Internship Tasks

This repository contains two key tasks from my internship:

# Task 1: Titanic Classification

Built a model to predict passenger survival using features like age, gender, and socio-economic status.

Key steps: Data preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, and modeling with RandomForestClassifier.


# Task 2: Feature Engineering


Created new features for enhanced predictions, including FamilySize, IsAlone, FarePerPerson, AgeGroup, and Title.

Improved dataset quality and insights for predictive modeling.


# Task 3: A/B Testing Analysis


This task presents the findings from an A/B testing analysis conducted to evaluate cart conversion rates (CCR) between two groups, Group A and Group B, and to identify trends in daily conversion rates. 

The goal is to provide actionable insights to optimize cart creation strategies
